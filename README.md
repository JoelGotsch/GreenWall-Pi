# GreenWall-Pi
Automating my Green wall system via a Raspberry Pi 4, dockerized in Python. It is used to automatically pump the water with a big pump to a reservoir, from where it is distributed with small pumps to 4 different sections. All of which is monitored by a Webcam.
Everything is syncronized with a blynk app so that I can control everything remotely, including seeing a picture of the wall currently.
